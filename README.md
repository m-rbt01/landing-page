# **Donjuan's Landing Page**
### **Static landing page that was styled using the Flexbox layout.**
This landing page was structured using three main sections: a header, main content, and a footer. These main sections include nested containers to assist in Flexbox layout. The purpose of this project was to build and layout a landing page from scratch, with a focus on using Flexbox alignment and positioning. The following are some of the main features used for layout:

* Use the column flex-direction for the three main sections
* Use justify-content to distribute space for header, hero, footer content
* Include nested flex containers within the information, quote, and welcome sections
* Use column flex-direction for the information section to stack content, and row flex-direction for the nested list container to align its nested list items
* Use row flex-direction for the quote section to align its content, and column flex-direction for the nested quote container to stack its nested text
* Restrict elements from shrinking when the window shrinks by using flex-shrink 
* Apply the hidden overflow property for the main containers to prevent overflow
